add pullup on I2C lines
reset pulled low with resistor

dont forget to add idwg back after everything's done

tin the under side of the oled ribbon cable

looks like all the probroems were from inconsistent connection between ribbon cable and pcb, tin the pcb thinly as well as the ribbon cable before soldering, use plenty of flux
line up the holes on the pcb with the holes on the ribbon cable, use a small pcb to hold it in place, like exixe 12

i seemlingly solved the ribbon cable connection issue by using low temp solder to wet the underside contacts, remains to be seen how it holds up
