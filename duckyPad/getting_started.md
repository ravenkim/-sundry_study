## Kit Assembly

If your duckyPad has not been assembled yet, [see this guide](/kit_assembly_guide.md) to put it together.

## Quick Start

Your duckyPad should come with a SD card already installed, containing some demo profiles.

Simply plug it into your computer, and voilÃ :

![Alt text](resources/pics/win_laptop.png)

* Press a key to execute the corresponding script.

* Press `+` and `-` button to switch profiles.

* **`Hold down`** `+` button for profile quickswitch.

* **`Hold down`** `-` button to change RGB backlight brightness.

* To change keyboard layout, **`HOLD DOWN TOP LEFT KEY`** while **`PLUGGING IT IN`**, then select your layout.

## Help! My duckyPad isn't working properly!

Are you using **`AMD motherboard?`** If so, read about the [USB chipset bug here!](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/amd-suggest-possible-fixes-for-usb-connectivity-issues)

Try updating chipset drivers, different ports, or use a USB hub.

For other issues, check out the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

## Writing Your Own Scripts

The samples might be fun, but duckyPad's true purpose is to do what YOU want! So here's how.

### SD Card

* duckyPad uses a microSD card to store profiles, scripts, and settings.

* To remove the SD card, push inwards to unlock.

* To install the SD card, insert logo side up, push until it clicks in place.

![Alt text](resources/pics/sd.jpg)

* You *can* insert/remove the SD card while duckyPad is on.

* If you decide to use your own SD card, it should be formatted in [FAT32 or FAT](resources/pics/format.PNG).

### Download the duckyPad Configurator

[Head here to download the latest release](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/releases) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Extract the `.zip` file and launch the application by clicking `duckypad_config.exe`:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/duckexe.png)

**Linux users** please take a look at [additional instructions](app_posix.md).

### "Untrusted App" Warnings

When trying to run the app, your system might complain about this software being untrusted. This is because I haven't had the code digitally signed, which costs hundreds of dollars a year.

Please feel free to [review the code](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/tree/master/pc_software). If you really don't trust the app, you can run the `duckypad_config.py` script itself with Python3. Finally, you can [configure your duckyPad completely manually](#Configure-duckyPad-Manually).

For Windows 10, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/defender.png)

For macOS, **`RIGHT CLICK`** on the app and select `Open`. You might have to do it twice.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/macos_warning.png)

### Using duckyPad configurator

After launching the app, it should look like this:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/unselected.png)

Make sure your duckyPad is plugged in, and press the `Connect` button.

It should then load all the data from duckyPad:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/overview.png)

#### (OPTIONAL) Load from SD card

If for some reason it didn't work, you can also **load from SD card**.

* Remove the SD card from duckyPad

* Mount it on your computer

* Select the **`entire SD card`**

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/select_root.png)

* It should load just the same

### Profiles

The GUI might look a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, let's break it down.

* The leftmost column is for *profiles*.

* Each profile contains a group of scripts corresponding to the keys on the duckyPad.

* As you can see, you typically create a profile for each app you want to control.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/profiles.png)

* Use the buttons to create a new profile, duplicate an existing profile, and remove/rename a profile.

* Use the up/down arrow button to reorder profiles.

* Choose a background color for the RGB backlight.

* `Activation color` is the color that a key changes into when you press it. On `Auto` it would be the inverse of background color.

* By default unused keys are dimmed, you can override this by unticking the checkbox.

### Keys

The middle column is for *keys*:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/keys.png)

* Here you can configure the 15 keys on your duckyPad.

* Click a key to select it.

* Type to give it a name, or click `Remove` to delete it.

* You can assign an unique color to each key, or use the same color as background.

* Drag a key to rearrange its order.

### Scripts

Finally, the rightmost column is for *scripts*:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/scripts.png)

* When you select a key, the script it will execute is displayed here.

* duckyPad uses duckyScript, please [read about its usage here](duckyscript_info.md).

* Code check will be performed as you type, errors will be highlighted in yellow.

* Press `Run this script!` to test-run it on your computer. **`MAKE SURE YOU TRUST THE SCRIPT!`**

* Test-run starts after a 2-second delay.

* Test-run can't get past [Windows User Account Control](resources/pics/app/uac.png) screens. You'll have to run it on real thing.

* On macOS, if test-run doesn't work, [go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility](resources/pics/app/macos.png), unlock, remove then add the app.

* Test-run might not be 100% accurate, some keys like `Capslock` and `Numlock` can't be emulated in software. Run your scripts on the real thing if you're not sure.

### Settings & Updates

One the bottom we have settings and updates section.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/settings.png)

By default, duckyPad goes to sleep after 30 minutes. Adjust the slider to set your own delay. Drag it all the way left for always-on.

`Updates` section shows available updates for this app and duckyPad firmware. **Click on the text** for instructions.

### Keyboard Layouts

duckyPad also supports multiple keyboard layouts.

Press `Keyboard Layouts...` button to open its setting:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/kbl_window.png)

* The app will pull [available keymaps](sample_profiles/keymaps) from this repo and display them in the left column.

* Select one and press `Add` to add it to your duckyPad.

* Up to 8 keymaps can be loaded at one time.

* To make your own keymap, see [this guide](./keymap_instructions.md).

* To change keyboard layout, **`HOLD DOWN TOP LEFT KEY`** while **`PLUGGING DUCKYPAD IN`**, then select your layout.

### Don't forget to save!

* Press the `Save` button to save the changes. It might take a few seconds.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/save.png)

### Making backups

* No storage media is 100% reliable, so it is very important to **`make backups`**!

* By default, a local backup is created every time `Save` button is pressed.

* Press `Backup...` button to access the backups.

* To restore a backup, [format the SD card in FAT or FAT32](resources/pics/format.PNG), then copy everything back.

### Run it!

duckyPad should automatically reboot when you press `Save`, and your new scripts will be ready to use!

If configuring via SD card, insert it back in duckyPad and power it on.

* Press a key to execute the corresponding script.

* Press `+` and `-` button to switch profiles.

* **`Hold down`** `+` button for profile quickswitch.

* **`Hold down`** `-` button to change RGB backlight brightness.

### Profile auto-switching

You can also [use this app](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad-profile-autoswitcher) to **switch profiles automatically** based on **current active window**. Check it out!

### Careful with Passwords!

It might be tempting to have duckyPad type out your often-used passwords, but it's probably **NOT a good idea**!

All scripts are stored as plain text on the SD card, and can be easily accessed by using a SD card reader, or though HID commands.

duckyPad is NOT intended to be a security device, so use at your own risk.

## Tips and Tricks

### Consolidate Keyboard Shortcuts

The most obvious use case is putting your commonly used hotkeys on duckyPad! Simply create a profile and add them in.

For many applications, you can find an official list of keyboard shortcuts. Just search `app_name shortcuts` on Google.

Some examples:

[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly) and [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

[Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) and [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201236)

[Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-word-95ef89dd-7142-4b50-afb2-f762f663ceb2), [Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f), [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-keyboard-shortcuts-to-create-powerpoint-presentations-ebb3d20e-dcd4-444f-a38e-bb5c5ed180f4), and other [Office apps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-office-e765366f-24fc-4054-870d-39b214f223fd).

[Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/photoshop/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts.html), [Final Cut Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/final-cut-pro/ver90ba5929/mac), and [Premiere Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/using/keyboard-shortcuts.html).

### Launching Apps on Windows - Using Task Bar

Another popular usage is launching apps. There are two ways of doing this. Here is the frist:

Find the app, `Right click -> More -> Pin to taskbar`:

![Alt text](resources/pics/start.png)

Now you can use `WIN + number` to launch the apps on the task bar:

![Alt text](resources/pics/taskbar.png)

In duckyScript, it would be `WINDOWS 1`, `WINDOWS 2`, etc...

### Launching Apps on Windows - Using Shortcuts

This method works with **`ANY FILE`**, not just apps!

`Right click` on any file, select `Send to... -> Desktop (create shortcut)`.

![Alt text](resources/pics/shortcut.png)

Find the new shortcut on your desktop, right click and select `Properties`

![Alt text](resources/pics/right_prop.png)

Set a hotkey in the `Shortcut Key` box:

![Alt text](resources/pics/sc_prop.png)

Then you can use duckyPad to press this combo to launch anything with a push of a button!

In this case, the duckyScript would be `CONTROL ALT D`.

### Launching Apps on macOS

Go to `System Preferences` -> `Keyboard` -> `Shortcuts` -> `App Shortcuts`:

Press the `+` button, select an app to open, assign a hotkey, and set up duckyPad accordingly:

![Alt text](resources/pics/mac_sc.png)

### Advanced Scripting with Autohotkey

You can use the free and open-source [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for even more sophisticated needs, such as controlling mouse movements, executing scripts, etc.

To do this, duckyPad can be set up to press a simple combo like `WIN + F1`, which then get captured by autohotkey to execute a more complex custom script on your PC.

* Download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)

* Download and save [this sample autohotkey script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/master/resources/duckypad_autohotkey_script.ahk) as an `.ahk` file.

* Switch the profile on duckyPad to [`autohotkey`](sample_profiles/profile7_autohotkey), and run the script by right clicking and select `Run Script`.

![Alt text](resources/pics/ahk_run.png)

* AHK will execute the script. Press any key on duckyPad, a corresponding message box will appear.

![Alt text](resources/pics/ahk_box.png)

* Now you can write your own autohotkey script to do whatever you want!

Check out the [official tutorials](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs_1.0/Tutorial.htm), the [autohotkey profile](sample_profiles/profile7_autohotkey), and the [sample autohotkey script](resources/duckypad_autohotkey_script.ahk) upon which you can tinker with.

[Follow this guide](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup) to run your AHK scripts automatically on Windows startup.

For macOS, you can try [bettertouchtool](https://folivora.ai).
